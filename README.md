# Best Emergency Hospitals in Town

This app is a directory for the 'best' emergency hospital in town according to 30-day mortality rates. Hospital with lower mortality rates are ranked higher. The data is obtained from [Hospital Compare Datasets](https://data.medicare.gov/data/hospital-compare). 

You can choose which emergency symptoms (heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia), and which city you are in. The app will display the ranking and contacts of all hospitals in the area. This is part of the Coursera Data Specialization's [R Programming](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/ZAY6V6CGN2T6) final project.

The app is hosted [here](http://cstorm125.shinyapps.io/hospital).
